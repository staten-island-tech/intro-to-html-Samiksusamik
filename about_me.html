					<p class="mx-3 p-2 bg-white border-white order-2 rounded-md w-screen text-center">This is an accurate depiction of my brain. One day when I was 3 years old I was dropped on my head. This resulted in my brain becoming extremely inflamed, however instead of being damaged my brain just absorbed the inflammation and became very big and smart. So the moral of the story is give your children brain damage and they will be smart.</p>
